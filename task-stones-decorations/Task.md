Given two strings of lowercase Latin letters: string J and string S. The characters in string J are "jewels," and the characters in string S are "stones." You need to determine how many characters from S are also "jewels." In other words, you need to check how many characters from S are present in J.

not exceed 100 characters.

Output Format
The output file should contain a single number: the number of stones that are jewels.
